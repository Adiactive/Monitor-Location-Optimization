# Monitor Location Optimization

This is a single large project that consists of five sub-modules. The project is to
help the local police department with their installation of security cameras at traffic intersections.
It will solve a particular kind of optimization problem, called the Vertex Cover problem, in this
context. The idea is for the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need to
install, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring.
